Project made for the web technologies exam.

It consists of a progressive web application made using the WebStorm IDE

Two files are missing in the /js folder: 
- LeafletKey.txt 
- OpenWeatherKey.txt

Those files contain the keys needed to use the Leaflet (MapBox) API and the OpenWeather API respectively.
If you want to clone this repository you should first generate those keys, add them to plain txt files named like said before and paste those files under the /js folder.

Also, the application needs the python server to be online to work, therefore start the server under /WeatherAgendaServer by sending the command "python main.py" to a shell opened on that folder.
